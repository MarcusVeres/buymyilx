    <section id="Intro">
        For sale is my 2013 Acura ILX 2.4L .Premium Package I've owned this vehicle since 2015 and it's been an absolute
        pleasure. The car drives and sounds great and has been treated with respect since it's purchase. The odometer
        currently reads 157K, vast majority was long distance/ highway driving.

        I’m in the process of to another country and the car is available from December

        Considering its age and mileage I would say the car is in "excellent" condition. Typical wear and tear/
        blemishes for a vehicle of this age are present. This is the last year Acura offered a Manual transmission with
        the k24 series motor.

        All repairs have been done by licensed mechanics, full synthetic oil changes performed every 7000 km’s and only
        used 93 octane fuel.

        The car comes with both summer and winter wheel/ tire packages

        Here’s a link for all the features of this vehicle.

        I'm selling the car as is. I am not in a rush to sell. I will also consider selling the car with safety at an
        additional cost determined in the negotiation.

                                        In 2014 I scraped the paint on a concrete pillar (underground parking lot).
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        It was not possible to simply repaint the door; they had to replace the panels
                                        with new ones (to match the paint). Since the scrape was long and thin, it went
                                        across three panels&hellip; and I had to replace all three of them!

                                        I couldn't afford that out-of-pocket so I went through insurance&mdash;and they
                                        went with a top-tier (read: expensive) body shop. Total cost of repair: $5500.00
